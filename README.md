# Final-Year-Project
Stop codon usage final year project

Python code is for parsing each of the datasets into csv files.
As python code was made in juptyer notebook the format of the python files may look odd. 
One set of files contains adjusted python files for running outside of juptyer.
Another set of files contains coding as completed in juptyer which contains a number of testing steps to ensure the code works correctly.
These extra steps will allow the thought process of the coding process to be more well understood.
R code is used for graph production and statistical analysis

Testing parsing.py allows for parsing of archaeal and bacterial datasets
Human examinations.py parses human genomes
Human binning.py places combined human genomes into bins
